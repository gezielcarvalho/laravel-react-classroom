# Success Criteria for Classroom Management Application

Defining success criteria tells you whether or not the project was successful. As a best practice, use a template like the one below to help you record, document and align stakeholders on key project components.

## Product Requirements

- Provide a secure, user-friendly platform for managing students and classrooms.
- Enable user authentication, role-based access control, and student management.
- Ensure scalability and modularity for future SaaS enablement.

## Priority Requirements

- Achieve 100% test coverage for backend and frontend code.
- Deliver core features (authentication, student management) by Q1.
- Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

## Goal Metrics

| Metric                               | Goal                                    | Actual |
| ------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- | ------ |
| **User engagement**                  | 80% of users actively engaged weekly    | TBD    |
| **User adoption**                    | 500 users within the first 6 months     | TBD    |
| **Technical issues/defects**         | Less than 5 critical issues post-launch | TBD    |
| **% of features delivered/released** | 100% of core features by Q1             | TBD    |
| **API response time**                | < 200ms for 95% of requests             | TBD    |
| **System uptime**                    | 99.9% uptime post-launch                | TBD    |

## Scoring OKRs

- OKRs will be graded using a scale from 0.0 to 1.0, where:
  - 1.0 indicates full achievement of the key result.
  - 0.7 indicates substantial progress but incomplete.
  - 0.0 indicates no progress made.
- Percentage completion may also be used for tracking progress on specific metrics.

## Regular Check-ins

- Weekly check-ins will be scheduled to review the status of OKRs and address any blockers.
- Check-ins will focus on:
  - Progress updates on key results.
  - Identifying risks and mitigation strategies.
  - Celebrating milestones to maintain team motivation.

## Accountability

- Ownership of key results will be assigned to specific team members to ensure clarity and responsibility.
- Example assignments:
  - **User engagement metrics:** Product Manager
  - **Technical issues/defects:** QA Lead
  - **Feature delivery:** Lead Developer

## Objectives and Key Results (OKRs)

- The success of the project will be tracked using the OKR framework, aligning objectives with measurable key results.
- Example OKRs:
  - **Objective:** Deliver a secure, user-friendly classroom management platform.
    - **Key Result 1:** Achieve 100% test coverage for backend and frontend code.
    - **Key Result 2:** Enable user registration, login, logout, and password reset with full test coverage.
    - **Key Result 3:** Allow staff to add, edit, and view student records via both API and web interface.
  - **Objective:** Establish a robust foundation for SaaS scalability.
    - **Key Result 1:** Refactor codebase for modularity and multi-tenancy support.
    - **Key Result 2:** Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.
    - **Key Result 3:** Integrate user roles and permissions with access control tests.
