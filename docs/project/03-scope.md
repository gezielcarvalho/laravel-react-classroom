# Project Scope for Classroom Management Application

## Scope Definition

The scope of this project is to develop a scalable, feature-rich classroom management application that serves the needs of educational institutions, teachers, and students. The application will provide core functionalities such as user authentication, student management, and classroom organization, with a roadmap for SaaS scalability and integrations.

### Deliverables

1. **Core Features:**

   - User authentication (registration, login, logout, password reset).
   - Student management (add, edit, view, delete student records).
   - Role-based access control (admin, teacher, student roles).
   - Secure API endpoints with comprehensive test coverage.

2. **SaaS Enablement:**

   - Multi-tenancy support for educational institutions.
   - Subscription and billing integration (Stripe, PayPal).
   - Analytics dashboards for performance tracking.

3. **Integrations:**

   - Integration with Learning Management Systems (e.g., Google Classroom, Moodle).
   - API for third-party developers.

4. **Quality Assurance:**
   - 100% test coverage for backend and frontend code.
   - CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment.

### Constraints

- **Time:**

  - The project will follow a phased timeline, with the foundation and core features targeted for completion in Q1.
  - SaaS enablement and integrations will be developed in subsequent quarters.

- **Cost:**

  - Budget allocation includes development resources, testing tools, and third-party integrations.
  - Open-source tools and frameworks (Laravel, React) will be leveraged to minimize costs.

- **Quality:**
  - The application will adhere to high-quality standards, including security, scalability, and maintainability.
  - Automated tests and code reviews will ensure reliability and robustness.

### Trade-offs

- Initial focus will be on delivering core features and achieving high test coverage, with advanced features and integrations planned for later phases.
- Time constraints may require prioritizing essential functionalities over optional enhancements in the early stages.

The Triple Constraint: In project management, time (the schedule and timeline), cost (the budget that determines what resources can be used), and scope (the deliverables and activities) make up the triple constraint.

The Fast, Cheap, Good Dilemma: Projects have to choose between speed, cost, and quality, and you can't have all three simultaneously. Adjustments to scope, time, or cost affect the other two, which in turn affects project outcomes.

Triangle Teaches Trade-offs: The project management triangle provides you with a convenient way to explain the interdependence of scope, time, and cost and the necessary trade-offs to clients.
