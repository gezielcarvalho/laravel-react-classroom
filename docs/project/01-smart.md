# SMART Goals for Classroom Management Application

## Definitions

- SMART Goals: SMART goals are defined as Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant, and Time-bound objectives that help clarify project success.
- Measurable: The 'Measurable' aspect of SMART goals allows project teams to assess success through quantifiable metrics, reducing ambiguity in expectations.
- Project Deliverables: Project deliverables are the tangible or intangible outcomes that are produced as a result of project activities, which should align with SMART goals.

## Inferred SMART Goals for Classroom Management Application

**Specific:**

- Provide a platform for managing students, user authentication, and classroom-related data.
- Allow users (teachers/admins) to register, log in, and manage student records.
- Enable password reset, email verification, and secure session/token-based authentication.
- Offer a user-friendly interface for adding, editing, and viewing students and user information.

**Measurable:**

- Users can successfully register, log in, and perform CRUD operations on students.
- All API endpoints are covered by automated tests (target: 100% code coverage).
- The application provides feedback for successful and failed authentication or data operations.

**Achievable:**

- Built with Laravel and React, using standard authentication, RESTful APIs, and modern frontend practices.
- Includes automated tests and code coverage tools to ensure reliability.

**Relevant:**

- Addresses the need for digital classroom management, student tracking, and secure user access.
- Supports features common in educational admin systems (student lists, user roles, password management).

**Time-bound:**

- The presence of a migration plan, testing guide, and action plans in the docs folder suggests a phased development and deployment timeline.
- The use of automated tests and coverage reports allows for tracking progress toward feature completion and quality goals.

**Summary of Inferred SMART Goals:**

1. Enable secure user registration, login, and password management for classroom staff by project launch.
2. Allow staff to add, edit, and view student records through a web interface and API, with all core features covered by automated tests before release.
3. Achieve and maintain 100% code coverage for all backend logic and critical frontend components within the development cycle.
4. Provide clear documentation and testing procedures to support maintainability and onboarding of new contributors.
5. Deploy a stable, user-friendly classroom management system within a defined project timeline, as outlined in the project documentation.
